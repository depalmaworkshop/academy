**10 Rs WIKI PAGE**

The “10 Rs” is a set of (interlinked) strategies that guide sustainable businesses in finding creative ways to optimise resource use and reduce or eliminate waste at each stage of the product lifecycle. In this way, the 10 Rs provides a framework for implementing the principles of the **_circular economy_**.  link to CE wiki page.

The 10 Rs are classified under three categories that represent the three lifecycle phases of a product (**_design & manufacture, consumption and end of life_**). The earlier the phase the more circular the strategy as the principles of value retention and waste reduction/elimination are “built in” to the product rather than considered after the fact. Implementing such circular strategies can however be more difficult as it involves challenging the status quo.

There are so many versions of the same thing that I’m not sure it’s so important to quote a source or make huge changes. I don’t talk about short, medium, long loops as it’s actually quite a complicated/unclear way to describe what I’ve described above.

Smarter product use and manufacture / **Design and manufacturing phase**

Refuse – Prevent the use of certain products, RMs and/or inputs in the creation of goods.

Reduce – minimise the use of (especially virgin) RMs and consumption of natural resources, reduce waste and the use of non-renewable resources, increase manufacturing efficiency

Rethink – designing for circularity (designing with circularity as starting point)

Extend lifespan of product and its parts / **Consumption phase**

            Reuse – secondary use by another owner for the same intended purpose

            Repair – maintain and repair existing defective product for extended use

Refurbish – restore & improve, upgrade & modernise product to a satisfactory condition for extended use

Remanufacture – use parts of discarded product in a new product with the same function (create a new product using a combination of reused, repaired and new parts – product has same specification as original)

Repurpose – use discarded product or its parts in a new product with a different function

Useful application of materials / **End of life phase**

Recycle – process waste into new products or materials that can be used for new products

Recovery – process waste to use as a resource/input
