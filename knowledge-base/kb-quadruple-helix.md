The quadruple Helix (co-developed by Elias G. Carayannis and David F.J. Campbell in 2009) is a model of innovation that recognises the role of four major actors in fostering entrepreneurship and driving innovation and economic growth in a knowledge-based economy and society:  academia, industry, government and the public (the latter represented by media, culture and civil society). The model helps to explain and visualise how knowledge (as a key resource) changes to innovation and know-how by circulating between societal subsystems (represented by helices) through dynamic interactions and exchange between these four actors.

In addition to emphasising collaboration and knowledge exchange in general, the quadruple helix model specifically encourages the consideration of societal perspectives, thereby democratising the innovation process to ensure more user-orientated innovations. 

**Quintuple Helix**

The quintuple helix extends the quadruple helix (link) model to incorporate a socioecological perspective, acknowledging the interactions and mutual influence between society and nature. It emphasises how these interactions can be utilised to address complex societal and environmental challenges through sustainable innovation.
