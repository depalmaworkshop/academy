# The Circular Economy – WIKI page

The Circular Economy (CE) is a model of production and consumption that aims to decouple economic growth from environmental pressure, especially the consumption of finite resources.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is the world’s leading organisation dedicated to accelerating the transition to a circular economy. It does this through evidence-based research, learning resources and a large network of dedicated key stakeholders engaged in implementing tangible solutions. Fashion is one of the foundation’s three focus sectors and as a result the foundation is considered to be a leading authority on the circular transformation of the fashion industry.

In a linear economy, natural resources are turned into products that are ultimately destined to become waste. According to the foundation, in contrast to this ‘take-make-waste’ linear model, a circular economy is “restorative and regenerative by design”. Within the circular economy, materials re-enter the economy at the end of their use and never become waste.

The circular economy is based on three principles:

·      **Designing out waste and pollution**. This includes the release of greenhouse gases and hazardous substances and the pollution of air, land, and water

·      **Circulating products and materials in the economy at their highest value.** This involves the use of bio-based materials as well as designing for durability, reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling

·      **Regenerating nature**. This involves avoiding the use of non-renewable resources and preserving or enhancing renewable ones

The “10 Rs” (Link) is a useful framework for implementing the principles of the circular economy. Like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, it considers the role of design as fundamental to the circular economy.  By designing for circularity, the creation of waste and pollution can be prevented from the outset and the regeneration of nature can be built into the process.
