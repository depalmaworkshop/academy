Published by Abraham Maslow in 1943, Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is a psychological theory and model for understanding human motivation and fulfilment. 

The basis of the theory is that human beings are motivated by their needs and that an individual’s most basic needs must be (mostly) met before they are motivated to progress to meet more advanced needs. The theory describes five levels of needs that must be met to achieve well-being as well as examples of ways in which each need can be fulfilled.

Change SOCIAL to “love and belonging”? (as original)

Maslow’s hierarchy is typically represented as a pyramid with the four lowest and biggest levels representing “deficiency” needs, those that an individual develops due to deprivation, the result of which is unpleasant. These deficiency needs can be further categorised as “basic” and “psychological” needs, essential for survival and/or well-being. The fifth level represents self-actualisation (the full realisation of one’s personal potential), a “growth” need, which is essential for fulfilment. Maslow argued that motivation in this highest level is found in opportunities for growth rather than in striving to attain something that is lacking.

The hierarchy has applications in various fields including (but not limited to) education, healthcare, child development, social justice, mental health, business leadership and marketing.
