A digital product is an intangible (or non-physical) product that is created, delivered and/or consumed in a digital format. In the apparel industry, Digital Product Creation (DPC) refers to:

a)     the process of collecting and storing data to generate digital representations (or twins) of products (and/or their components and processes) that can be used to realise value without physical inventory

b)    the process of utilising technology to design, develop, prototype and test the performance of products prior to the production of physical products

c)     the process of utilising advanced technology to manufacture products

The most common applications currently include:

·      3D visualisation of materials and products (virtual sampling)

·      Virtual reality (virtual try-on technology)

·      3D knitting

·      Digital printing

·      Product marketing and promotion

The benefits of DPC include:

·      Streamlined and accelerated design and development process

·      Improved accuracy in development

·      Facilitates iteration and experimentation

·      Opportunities for improved collaboration and communication

·      Reduced waste

·      Reduced sampling costs

·      Reduced time to market

·      Increased consumer engagement

·      Facilitates demand-driven production models including customisation
