In March 2022, the European Commission proposed an [Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_2013) (ESPR) as part of the Commission's Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) under the European Green Deal. Building on the existing [Ecodesign Directive](https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/energy-label-and-ecodesign_en) which focuses solely on the energy performance of energy-related products, the proposal expands the scope of Ecodesign requirements to prioritise other highly-impactful products and industries (including textiles, garments and footwear) and to promote circularity.

According to the [European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/sustainable-products/about-sustainable-products_en#:~:text=well%20under%2010%25.-,Up%20to%2080%25%20of%20a%20product's%20environmental%20impacts%20can,determined%20at%20the%20design%20phase.), up to 80% of a product's lifecycle environmental impact is determined at the design phase. By requiring circular principles to be built into the product at the design phase, the proposal aims to help make more sustainable products the norm in the EU.

The proposal’s key focus areas include:

- product durability and repairability
- chemical substances that inhibit reuse and recycling of materials
- substances of concern
- energy and resource efficiency
- recycled content
- environmental footprints (including carbon footprint)
- collection and provision of sustainability-related product information (specifically via a **Digital Product Passport**) LINK
