In March 2022, the European Commission proposed an [Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_2013) (ESPR) Link to WIKI page as part of the Commission's Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) under the European Green Deal. Building on the existing [Ecodesign Directive](https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/energy-label-and-ecodesign_en) which focuses solely on the energy performance of energy-related products, the proposal expands the scope of Ecodesign requirements to prioritise other highly-impactful products and industries (including textiles, garments and footwear) and to promote circularity. In this way it aims to help make sustainable products the new norm in the EU.

Requirements under the proposal include the collection and provision of sustainability-related product information. This is designed to ensure that consumers and businesses understand the environmental impact of their purchases and can make more informed – and more sustainable – decisions regarding the purchase, use and disposal of products. By 2030, all regulated products will need to have a Digital Product Passport (DPP), a tag (or other data carrier) attached to the product that can be scanned to access information including (but not limited to) a product’s lifecycle impact, durability, reparability and recycled content. The DPP will also facilitate the tracking of substances of concern throughout the supply chain.
