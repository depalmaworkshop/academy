Note - The scope of our product is beyond the physical product. So we can add to the below

Individual features of a garment can give it one or more functions that benefit - or help to meet the needs of - the consumer and/or society. These functions can be categorised into four groups: **_Aesthetic_**, **_Social_**, **_Economic_** and **_Technical_**. A garment’s function(s) contribute to its overall utility. (link to glossary)

Technical function

Through material/component choice, technical finishes and/or garment construction, clothing can keep people safe from (and prevent discomfort within) the environment that surrounds them and can protect the environment around them from damage or contamination.
