**Open source**

Opensource is a concept that initially applied only to computer software. It describes a type of computer software that is publicly accessible and comes with an **_opensource license_** (link to glossary/short WIKI definition) that grants users various rights (including the right to use, examine, modify and distribute the software and its source code) and dictates the terms of such use, modification and distribution. The opensource model is a form of **_open collaboration_** (link to glossary/short WIKI definition), inviting participation and contributions from a diverse range of individuals and encouraging an open and inclusive environment for creating and modifying software.  The opensource concept emerged as a response to the drawbacks of proprietary code including limited customisation options and vendor dependence.

The [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/definition-annotated) is a document, maintained by the Open Source Initiative, that outlines the policies, principles and set of rules that define opensource software. These rules centre around free redistribution without fee or royalty, terms of distribution of modifications and derived works, provision of source code, non-discrimination and technology-neutrality.

The opensource movement and development model have inspired increased transparency and knowledge-sharing within other industries. Consequently, the term open source has taken on a broader informal definition to describe something people can use, modify and share because its design, data, specifications and/or “recipe” is publicly accessible. In these industries, opensource products, projects and initiatives tend to centre around sustainable innovation and **_corporate social responsibility_** (Link to glossary?) and are created, worked on and shared following the “opensource way”, which is based on the following key principles:

·       Transparency

·       Collaborative participation

·       Decentralisation

·       Iterative development

·       Inclusiveness

·       Merit-based status and decision making

·       Shared values

·       Community-based development

**_Open innovation_** (link to glossary) may be a more accurate term to describe many of these products, projects and initiatives. Whist both concepts are rooted in principles of collaborative participation and are facilitated by advances in information and communication technology, they differ in the following key ways:

·       Open innovation is firm-centric, describing knowledge-sharing across organisational boundaries to access a larger pool of ideas and/or accelerate internal innovation. Opensource on the other hand prioritises collective ownership

·       Opensource focuses on peer production and self-organising communities of individuals. These individuals actively define and uphold the structures and shared objectives that guide their collaboration in a dynamic and ongoing process. Under open innovation however the organisation usually defines goals and controls task allocation

·       The conditions for opensource participation are defined through an economic and legal framework (licensing framework) whilst organisations engaged in open innovation must create their own architecture to direct and manage activities and interactions

**Open innovation**

Open innovation is a concept that originated with the 2003 publication of [_Open Innovation_](http://www.amazon.com/Open-Innovation-Imperative-Profiting-Technology/dp/1422102831/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1284996914&sr=1-1), a book by the organisational theorist and business school professor, Henry Chesbrough.

In his more recent publications, he defines open innovation as “a distributed innovation process based on purposively managed knowledge flows across organisational boundaries, using pecuniary and non-pecuniary mechanisms in line with the organisation's business model".

In simpler terms, it describes combining internal and external knowledge and resources to carry out innovation projects and bring new products and technologies to market.

According to Chesbrough, the adoption of open innovation is motivated by the fact that “useful knowledge today is widely distributed, and no company, no matter how capable or how big, could innovate effectively on its own”. It is facilitated by advances in information and communication technology, lower geographical boundaries and the adoption of an information age mindset.

Examples of open innovation include:

·       Co-creation

·       Collaborative product design and development

·       Joint Ventures

·       Start-up incubation programmes

·       Co-branding

·       Crowdsourcing

·       Community input

·       Licensing

·       Partnerships

·       Spinoffs

·       Use of published patents

Two types of open innovation exist (which can be employed in combination):

_Outside-in_ - ideas and technologies are brought into the company’s innovation process from external sources

_Inside-out_ - unused and/or underutilised ideas and technologies are allowed to go outside the company so that other businesses can incorporate them into their innovation processes

The core advantage of open innovation lies in knowledge transfer across diverse industries and disciplines. By bringing together diverse expertise and insights, open innovation unlocks fresh perspectives and creates new opportunities. It facilitates, and to a certain extent even requires, a non-linear innovation process.

**Open collaboration**

Any system of innovation or production that relies on goal-oriented yet loosely coordinated participants who interact to create a product (or service) of economic value which is made available to contributors and noncontributors alike.  [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263545221_Open_Collaboration_for_Innovation_Principles_and_Performance](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263545221_Open_Collaboration_for_Innovation_Principles_and_Performance)

Can we use/quote the above definition?

Open collaboration is based on the following principles:

·       Open access to contribute, consume, interact or exchange (no barriers to participation)

·       Decisions and status are merit-based and not imposed

·       Development decisions are based on product quality and integrity rather than deadlines and profit margins

·       The result is made available to noncontributors as well as contributors

Examples of open collaboration include:

·      Opensource software

·      Open data projects

·      Internet forums

·      Online communities

**Opensource license**

Opensource licenses are used to facilitate opensource software development. Whilst a proprietary software license grants permission to another party to use software (code) under certain legal terms and conditions, an opensource license grants permission for any party to not only use the software (code) but also to modify it and distribute the modifications for any purpose. License terms outline the specific conditions under which the software (code) can be distributed.  

Every opensource project must have an opensource license, the terms of which must comply with the criteria outlined in the Open Source Definition (link), maintained by the Open Source Initiative (link) as follows:

·      Free redistribution - the license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale

·      The program must include source code and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form

·      Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost

·      The license must allow modifications and derived works and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software

·      The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code

·      No discrimination against persons or groups

·      No discrimination against fields of endeavour

·      The rights must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed – no additional license should be required

·      License must not be specific to a product

·      License must not restrict other software

·      License must be technology-neutral

There are over 200 opensource licenses that are approved by the OSI which generally belong to one of two main categories of opensource license:

**Permissive license**

A permissive license grants developers freedom of reuse, modification, and distribution with no obligation to share modifications or disclose the source code. It allows developers to incorporate opensource code into their projects including proprietary software.

[**Copyleft license**](https://snyk.io/learn/what-is-copyleft-license/) 

A copyleft license requires any derivative works to be distributed under the same (or comparable) license as the original software. The software and its derivatives must therefore remain free and open for everyone to use, modify, and redistribute. This limits the ability to incorporate derivative works into proprietary software or closed-source projects.  A copyleft license can be further described as strong or weak based on the definition of “derivative works”.
