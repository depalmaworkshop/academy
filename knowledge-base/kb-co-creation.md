Co creation is a collaborative design and innovation process in which the creation of products, services or solutions is guided by insights and input from a community of stakeholders and/or experts from within (or even outside) the value chain.  

The definitions of co creation and open innovation (link) share many similarities.

Both focus on value creation through combining internal and external knowledge and resources to carry out innovation projects.  The concept of open innovation is broader and represents a strategic approach to value creation whilst co creation is more project-focused and structured. Co creation is considered by many to be a form of open innovation.
