Design thinking is a customer-focused, non-linear, iterative approach to innovation. Multi-disciplinary teams participate in an almost continuous process of problem exploration and insight-generation to design creative out-of-box solutions.

The most well-known model of design thinking was developed by the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, Stanford. It includes five phases:

**Empathise** – identify the root causes of the problem(s) and understand user needs

**Define** – define the problem(s) clearly

**Ideate** – brainstorm a wide range of potential solutions and choose the most viable

**Prototype** – create inexpensive, scaled-down versions of products or features

**Test** - test with users and collect feedback for further development

After the initial empathise, define and ideate phases, frequent testing and feedback cycles based on simple prototypes and small interventions generate new insights at any stage in the design process.  These insights will either redefine the problem, identify new problems or create new ideas to prototype and test. Design teams will therefore frequently jump from one phase to another.

Design Thinking is similar to the concept of Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) link in that both represent customer-centric approaches to innovation that focus on problem-exploration. However, Design Thinking is more of a mindset and way of working whilst JTBD is a specific approach to understanding customers’ needs.
